## Overview
The purpose of the overall analysis was to help investors decide if they should contribute to a new venture; a Surf and Ice Cream shop in Oahu, Hawaii. The initial analysis concentrated on weather trends from August 2016 to August 2017 with a focus on amount of precipitation, the number of weather stations reporting weather data and how active they were in reporting.  These questions were all answered but the potential investors came back with another concern.  They would like to see the temperature trends for the months of June and December specifically.  This analysis focuses on the requested trends with data from January 2010 to December 2017 to see if the business can be sustained all year.
